# Math311_linear_algebra_projects

this is a repository of projects for the math311 linear algebra course at winona state university. it uses google colab and coding in python to explore linear algebra concepts.

short narrative: this readme includes some notable projects i completed in my linear algebra class during my first semester at winona state, incluting interactive links to all projects. this repository was required for class and created in september 2025. all projects use python. all base structure of code was from my professor, Aaron Wangberg, and i modified, worked with, and adjusted the code for my class assignments.
